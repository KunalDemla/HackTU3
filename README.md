## Crylya

The Crylya wheelchair has been thoughtfully designed to help specially-abled people overcome their disabilities and dependence on others. With its special features, it will help them get around all physical and other barriers, that prevent persons with disabilities from equally accessing opportunities and participating fully in all aspects of life. It aids with basic provisions so they donâ€™t have to rely on anyone else and go through the emotional turmoil of feeling like a burden to others. We wish to give these people a feeling of independence, self-respect, and dignity. To achieve this purpose we added features like autopilot navigation, manual navigation via joysticks, a fall detection alert system, buttons with LCD display, and alerts for the requirement of food, water, restroom, pain alert, along with health parameter monitors.

### App UI Design
We have used Figma to design our Application

### Features

Some of the features and solutions offered are:
* Autopilot to navigate through obstacles easily.
* Joystick to navigate manually.
* LCD with buttons to call for food, water, toilet, basic amenities or emergencies.
* Heart rate, SpO2 and blood pressure measuring sensor to keep a regular track of body functioning without having to run to a doctor frequently.
* Headlights to not limit movement to just light time of the day or to well-lit places.
* Fall alert : If the wheelchair is switched on and the sensor detects that no one is sitting on the chair then a notification will be sent on the app and a message will be sent to a listed emergency contact.
